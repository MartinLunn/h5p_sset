## H5P Command Line Interface

A tool that simplifies the development process of [H5P](https://h5p.org) (HTML5 Packages).

The H5P development documentation is found on [h5p.org/developers](https://h5p.org/developers)

Note that this tool is still in alpha!

## Install

`sudo npm install -g h5p`

Make sure ssh-agent is running and that `ssh -T git@github.com` works.

## H5P developer server

The H5P cli tool makes it possible to run a H5P development server using node.js. The server needs some input to be able to start. This input should be placed in a h5p-server.json file, and must contain the following:

```javascript
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "libraryDir": "<name of directory where libraries are found>",
  "mainLibraryDir": "<the directory where the main library is found>",
  "contentDir": "<the directory where content is found>"
}
```
An example of the complete directory structure is found below:
```
.
├── h5p-server.json
├── h5p-content
│   ├── blanks
│      ├── blanks-example-1
│         ├── content.json
│      ├── blanks-example-2
|         ├── content.json
├── h5p-libs
│   ├── h5p-blanks
│   ├── h5p-question
│   ├── <...>
```
With the above example structure, the h5p-server.json below is created to be able to view the Fill in the blanks H5Ps (located in the h5p-content/blanks directory):
```javascript
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "libraryDir": "h5p-libs",
  "mainLibraryDir": "h5p-blanks",
  "contentDir": "h5p-content/blanks"
}
```
To start the H5P development server with the above setup, run the following command from within the directory the h5p-server.json file is located:

`h5p server`

The development server should now be available at http://localhost:8080
